    question: "How quickly can I get a dumpster delivered in Martinez?",

    question: "What size dumpster is best for renovating older homes in Martinez?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        Martinez has many historic and older homes that require careful renovation. For most projects — kitchen remodels, bathroom updates, or foundation work — a <strong>20-yard dumpster</strong> is ideal. It handles plaster, old lumber, fixtures, and demolition debris. For whole-home renovations or additions, the 30-yard is your best bet.

  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for a dumpster in Martinez?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        If you place the dumpster on your own driveway or private property, no permit is typically required in Martinez. For street placement in Downtown Martinez or historic neighborhoods, you may need a temporary encroachment permit from the City of Martinez. We can help you determine the best placement for your property.

        Yes! We serve all of North Contra Costa County including <strong>Benicia, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Hercules, Pacheco,</strong> and surrounding communities. One call covers dumpster delivery anywhere in North CCC — no extra travel charges.
