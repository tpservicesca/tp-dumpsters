    question: "How quickly can I get a dumpster delivered in Hercules?",

      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        We offer <strong>same-day and next-day delivery</strong> throughout Hercules and West Contra Costa County. Whether you&apos;re in Victoria by the Bay, Refugio Valley, or near Downtown Hercules, we can typically have a dumpster on-site within hours when you call before noon.

    question: "What size dumpster do I need for a Hercules home renovation?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        For typical Hercules home renovations — kitchen remodels, bathroom updates, or flooring projects — a <strong>20-yard dumpster ($649)</strong> is the most popular choice. For larger projects like whole-home renovations or new construction cleanup in Hercules&apos; growing developments, the 30-yard at $749 provides ample capacity.

  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for a dumpster in Hercules?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        If you place the dumpster on your own private property or driveway, no permit is typically required in Hercules. For street placement, you may need a temporary encroachment permit from the City of Hercules. Most of our Hercules customers have adequate driveway space, so street placement is rarely necessary.

    question: "Do you serve Pinole, Rodeo, and other nearby communities?",

        Yes! We serve all of West Contra Costa County including <strong>Pinole, Rodeo, Martinez, El Sobrante, Crockett,</strong> and San Pablo. One call covers dumpster delivery anywhere in the area — no extra travel charges for these communities.
