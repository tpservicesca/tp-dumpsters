    question: "How quickly can I get a dumpster delivered in Danville?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        We offer <strong>same-day and next-day delivery</strong> throughout Danville and the San Ramon Valley. Whether you&apos;re in Blackhawk, Sycamore Valley, or Downtown Danville, we can typically have a dumpster on-site within hours when you call before noon.

    question: "What size dumpster is best for a luxury home renovation in Blackhawk or Diablo?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        For high-end renovations in Danville&apos;s premium communities — <strong>Blackhawk estates, Diablo properties, or large homes in Alamo</strong> — the <strong>30-yard dumpster ($749)</strong> is the most popular choice. It handles full kitchen remodels, master suite additions, and multi-room projects without needing multiple pickups.

  {
    question: "Can you deliver dumpsters to gated communities and hillside estates?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        Absolutely. We regularly service <strong>Blackhawk Country Club, Diablo Country Club,</strong> and other gated communities throughout Danville and Alamo. Just provide us with access instructions or gate codes when you book, and our drivers will coordinate with your HOA or property management if needed.
      </p>

  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for a dumpster in Danville?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        If the dumpster is placed on your private property or driveway, no permit is typically required in Danville. For street placement, you may need a temporary encroachment permit from the Town of Danville. Most Danville estates have ample driveway or side-yard space for dumpster placement.
      </p>

    question: "Do you serve Alamo, San Ramon, and Walnut Creek too?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        Yes! We serve the entire San Ramon Valley including <strong>Alamo, San Ramon, Walnut Creek, Lafayette,</strong> and Pleasanton. One call covers dumpster delivery anywhere in the area — no extra travel charges for neighboring communities.
      </p>

  {
    question: "How much does a dumpster rental cost in Danville?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        Danville dumpster rental prices start at <strong>$599 for a 10-yard</strong> dumpster (7-day rental, 1 ton included). The 20-yard starts at $649 and the 30-yard at $749. No hidden fees, no surprise charges. Call <strong>(510) 650-2083</strong> for an exact quote for your Danville project.
