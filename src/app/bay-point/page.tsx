      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        We offer <strong>same-day and next-day delivery</strong> throughout Bay Point and East
        Contra Costa County. Whether you&apos;re in Shore Acres, Bella Vista, or near Port
        Chicago, we can typically have a dumpster on-site within hours when you call before noon.

    question: "What size dumpster do I need for a home cleanout in Bay Point?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        For a typical Bay Point home cleanout, a <strong>20-yard dumpster</strong> is the most
        popular choice. It handles furniture, appliances, boxes, and general household debris.
        For smaller garage cleanouts, a 10-yard works well. For whole-house renovations or major
        cleanups, go with the 30-yard.
      </p>

  {
    question: "Can you deliver near the waterfront and Clyde areas?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        Absolutely! We deliver throughout all Bay Point neighborhoods including <strong>waterfront
        areas, Clyde, Shore Acres,</strong> and Port Chicago. Our drivers are familiar with the
        area&apos;s streets and can navigate to any location in Bay Point.
      </p>

  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for a dumpster in Bay Point?",
    answer: (
      <p className="text-sm text-[#666] leading-[1.7] mb-2.5">
        If the dumpster is placed on your private property or driveway, no permit is typically
        required in Bay Point. For street placement, you may need a permit from Contra Costa
        County. Our team can advise on the best placement for your specific location.

    question: "Do you also serve Pittsburg, Concord, and Martinez?",

        Yes! We serve all of East Contra Costa including <strong>Pittsburg, Concord, Martinez,
        and Antioch</strong>. Bay Point&apos;s central location and eBART connection mean we can
